Flask Web Application
This is a simple Flask web application that serves HTTP requests and provides weather information for London, UK.

Prerequisites
Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.docker.com/
Build and Run the Application
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd flask-web-app
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my_flask_app .
Run the Docker container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 my_flask_app
The Flask application is now running inside the Docker container. You can access the application in your web browser or using tools like curl or Postman.

To access the home page, go to: http://localhost:8080/
To check the server health, go to: http://localhost:8080/health
To ping the server, go to: http://localhost:8080/ping
API Key for Weather Information
The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information for London, UK. It requires an API key to make API requests. The API key is already included in the application code for demonstration purposes.

In a real-world scenario, it's recommended to store sensitive information like API keys securely, such as using environment variables.

Customization
If you want to customize the application or add more features, you can edit the app.py file to make the necessary changes. After making modifications, you can rebuild the Docker image and rerun the container.

Important Notes
Make sure port 8080 is available on your system before running the Docker container.
If you encounter any issues or errors, ensure that Docker is running and the necessary ports are not blocked.
That's it! You now have the Flask web application up and running using Docker. Feel free to explore and extend the application as needed.

In the above README file, I've provided step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the Flask application using Docker. I also mentioned the API key for weather information and provided some customization notes. Please customize the README file further as per your specific project requirements.
